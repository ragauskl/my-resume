    "intro": "Hi, I'm a passionate Full-stack JavaScript Developer. <b>Eager to learn</b>, <b>curious</b>, <b>determined</b> and <b>responsible</b> are four words that I believe describe me the best. I started programming from 10th grade and since then realised that Software Engineering is something I would be thrilled to work on daily for the rest of my life. Initially, I was focusing on Software Engineering and took on <b>placement</b> as an <b>Undergraduate Software Engineer</b> in Sorion Ltd, automotive industry. However, during placement, over my free time, I gained a huge interest in Full-stack Development for both websites and mobile applications.<br><br>Now I work with <b>Angular</b>, <b>Ionic</b> and <b>Node.js</b> and have a bit more than a <b>year of experience with these frameworks</b>.  I love working on both sides of the spectrum, Front-end and Back-end, however, I feel that if I had to choose, Back-end would be my stronger side. I <b>constantly work on improving my skills</b> and enjoy learning new frameworks or programming languages (e.g. Go). Besides coding, I also like to work with graphic design software and pervasive systems.<br><br> I work well both in teams and on my own and have <b>experience working in Agile environment</b>. I'm also an active person and love outdoor and indoor activities.",

The mobile application also has a feature to live-track a saved route and warn the user if wandering off too far away from the selected path. The mobile application has been built using <b>Ionic 3 (Angular 5)</b> and the API has been built using <b>Node.js</b>. Application data is stored in a <b>MongoDB</b> database. For this project, <b>Google Maps</b>, <b>Directions</b> and <b>Places APIs</b> were used."

I was responsible for developing the API, creating a database as well as providing support to hardware team.
