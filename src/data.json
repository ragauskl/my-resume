    "intro": "Hi, I'm a passionate software and web engineer. <b>Eager to learn</b>, <b>curious</b>, <b>determined</b> and <b>responsible</b> are four words that I believe describe me the best.\nI started programming from 10th grade and since then I realised that software engineering is something I would be thrilled to work on daily for the rest of my life. Initially, I was focusing on software engineering and took on placement as an <b>Undergraduate Software Engineer</b> in Sorion Ltd, automotive industry. However, during placement, over my free time, I gained a huge interest in full-stack development for both websites and mobile applications and since then I started to work on personal projects at home and use <b>Angular</b>, <b>Ionic</b> and <b>NodeJS</b> in all university projects.\nI love working on both sides of the spectrum, front-end and back-end, however, I feel that if I had to choose, back-end would be my stronger side. Besides coding, I also like to work with graphic design software and pervasive systems.\nI'm also an active person and love outdoor and indoor activities, while I love sports, I can't say I'm a fan of watching sports teams on television.",
